Teamtreehouse - Project 4<br />
OOP Game App

Hello Internet.

I built this [browser-based, word guessing game](https://ragatep.github.io/OOP_Game_Show_App/) to demonstrate my undertanding of object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) principles. This build is for a project from Teamtreehouse's Techdegree Full Stack Javascript Unit 4. 

How to play **PHRASE HUNTER**

- After clicking on the Start Gamne button, the PHRASE HUNTER gameboard will load a random phrase with its letters represented by blank boxes.

- Guess a letter by clicking on a key frpm the onscreen keyboard to complete the phrase. You can only guess a letter once and allowed to make five incorrect guesses.

- If the letter guessed is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

- Continue to click on letters until you complete the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

- If you complete the before you run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If you guess incorrectly fives times, a losing screen appears. If

*Good luck.*
